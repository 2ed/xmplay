/* Enabling lua (and LÃ–VE) with ability to play .xm files!

  First, Lua is an interpreted language, largerly written in C and
  having _really_ nice C interface by design. Prom practical point of
  view it means that Lua has an ability to load functions from
  compiled C files, so we can write C functions and register them in
  Lua interpreter, using standard methods.

  We already can init mikmod via C, load and play files. Lets take a look at
  C-Lua interface.  If we read https://www.lua.org/pil/26.2.html, we can
  find some interesting things:

  1. Typically, a C library has one single public (extern) function, which
  is the function that opens the library.

  2. Lua "sees" C functions through this registration process.

  3. So, to define a Lua library in C, one must create an array that looks like
  this:

    static const struct luaL_reg mylib [] = { {"dir", l_dir}, {NULL, NULL}
      };

     This array has elements of type luaL_reg, which is a structure with two
     fields: a string and a function pointer.

     Then, a compiled .so file must have a function with signature

    int luaopen_LIBNAME(lua_State *);

     which has

    luaL_openlib(L, "LIBNAME", LIBNAME, 0);

     function call. It's like main function for regular C programs. When we
     write 'require("mylib")' in Lua, interpreter seeks for mylib.so file in
     search path, and then calls function named 'luaopen_mylib' in it. I
     think it's just a plain dlsym call. Please look in 'man 3 dlsym' if
     you're interested c:

  4. All functions to be registered must have type

    int my_func(lua_State *);

  5. If we want to pass arguments to our function, we must use special
  functions like lua_to<SOMETHING> from Lua-C API:

    double d = lua_tonumber(L, 1); -- to get a number, where L is lua_State
    pointer which is passed to our function

     The full list of such functions available here:
     https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#3.7

  6. If we want to return a value to Lua, we must use functions
  lua_push<SOMETHING>, to push value to stack:

    lua_pushnumber(L, 34.0d); */

       inter-thread communication is a very separate business from
       just thread creation. So we could create threads, but have no

	   what I love about C is that all pointers are equal, and void * is
       just a polymorhic interface, which helps us pass all we want around
       the program.  Just cast your data to void *, and then cast back to
       original type in reciever function. Useful! Beautiful! */
